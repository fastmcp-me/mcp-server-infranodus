## Installation

The easiest and the fastest way to launch the InfraNodus MCP server is to use the external provider, Smithery, and simply copy and paste the settings to the tool of your choice (e.g. Claude, Cursor, or ChatGPT).

You can also install the server locally, so you have more control over it. In this case, you can also edit the source files and even create your tools based on the [InfraNodus API](https://infranodus.com/api).

Below we describe the two different ways to set up your InfraNodus MCP server.

### 1. Easiest Setup: Smithery InfraNodus MCP Server (via HTTP/SSE)

0. **Prerequisites**

- Create an account on [Smithery.Ai](https://smithery.ai/) (it's free and you can use your Google or GitHub login)
- Create an account on [InfraNodus](https://infranodus.com) if you don't have it already and get your [InfraNodus API Key](https://infranodus.com/api-access). We offer 14-day free trials.
- Then go to the [Smithery InfraNodus Server](https://smithery.ai/server/@infranodus/mcp-server-infranodus), click "Configure" at the top right, and add your InfraNodus API key there.

1. **Get the URL of the InfraNodus Server from Smithery**

- Go to [Smithery InfraNodus Server](https://smithery.ai/server/@infranodus/mcp-server-infranodus) and get the URL link from Smithery [https://server.smithery.ai/@infranodus/mcp-server-infranodus/mcp](https://server.smithery.ai/@infranodus/mcp-server-infranodus/mcp) for the server or use one of their automatic setup tools for Claude or Cursor.

2. **Add to to the Client Tool Where You Want to Use InfraNodus**

- Once you add the URL above to your tool, it will automatically prompt you to authenticate using Smithery (via Oauth) in order to be able to access the InfraNodus MCP hosted on it.

- If your client does not support Oauth, you can click the link \*Get the URL with keys instead\*\* which you can use to authenticate without Oauth.

- In the end, if you use the URL with the keys, either Smithery or you yourself will add something like this in your MCP configuration file:

#### For Cursor:

```json
// e.g. Cursor will access directly the server via Smithery
"mcpServers": {
    "mcp-server-infranodus": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://server.smithery.ai/@infranodus/mcp-server-infranodus/mcp?api_key=YOUR_SMITHERY_KEY&profile=YOUR_SMITHERY_PROFILE",
      "headers": {}
    }
  }
```

### For Claude:

```json
// Claude uses a slightly different implementation
// Fot this, it launches the MCP server on your local machine
"mcpServers": {
   "mcp-server-infranodus": {
			"command": "npx",
			"args": [
				"-y",
				"@smithery/cli@latest",
				"run",
				"@infranodus/mcp-server-infranodus",
				"--key",
				"YOUR_SMITHERY_KEY",
				"--profile",
				"YOUR_SMITHERY_PROFILE"
			]
		}
  }
```

**Note**, in both cases, you'll automatically get the `YOUR_SMITHERY_KEY` and `YOUR_SMITHERY_PROFILE` values from Smithery when you copy the URL with credentials. These are not your InfraNodus API keys. You can use the InfraNodus API server without the API for the first 70 calls. Then you can add it to your Smithery profile and it will automatically connect to your account using the link above.

4. **Using InfraNodus Tools in Your Calls**

- To use InfraNodus, see the tools available and simply call them through the chat interface (e.g. "show me the graphs where I talk about this topic" or "get the content gaps from the document I uploaded")

- If your client is not using InfraNodus for some actions, add the instruction to use InfraNodus explicitly.

### 2. Manual Setup: via NPX

You can deploy the InfraNodus server manually via `npx` — a package that allows to execute local and remote Node.Js packages on your computer.

The InfraNodus MCP server is also available as an npm package at [https://www.npmjs.com/package/infranodus-mcp-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/infranodus-mcp-server) from where you can launch it remotely on your local computer with npx. It will expose its tools to the MCP client that will be using this command to launch the server

#### For Claude Desktop:

Just add this in your Claude's configuration file (Settings > Developer > Edit Config), inside the `"mcpServers"` object where the different servers are listed:

```json
   "infranodus": {
			"command": "npx",
			"args": ["-y", "infranodus-mcp-server"],
			"env": {
				"INFRANODUS_API_KEY": "YOUR_INFRANODUS_API_KEY"
			}
   },
```

### 3. Manual Setup: Launching MCP as a Local Server (for inspection & development)

0. **Prerequisites**

- Node.js 18+ installed
- InfraNodus API key (get yours at [https://infranodus.com/api-access](https://infranodus.com/api-access))

1. **Clone and build the server:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mcp-server-infranodus.git
   cd mcp-server-infranodus
   npm install
   npm run build:inspect
   ```

Note that `build:inspect` will generate the `dist/index.js` file which you will then use in your server setup. The standard `npm run build` command will only build a Smithery file.

2. **Set up your API key:**

   Create a `.env` file in the project root:

   ```
   INFRANODUS_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   ```

3. **Inspect the MCP:**

   ```bash
   npm run inspect
   ```

### Claude Desktop Configuration (macOS)

1. Open your Claude Desktop configuration file:

   ```bash
   open ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
   ```

2. Add the InfraNodus server configuration:

a. remote launch via `npx`:

```json
 "infranodus": {
			"command": "npx",
			"args": ["-y", "infranodus-mcp-server"],
			"env": {
				"INFRANODUS_API_KEY": "YOUR_INFRANODUS_API_KEY"
			}
   },
```

b. launch this repo with `node`:

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"infranodus": {
			"command": "node",
			"args": ["/absolute/path/to/mcp-server-infranodus/dist/index.js"],
			"env": {
				"INFRANODUS_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
			}
		}
	}
}
```

**Note:** you can leave the `INFRANODUS_API_KEY` empty in which case you can make 70 free requests after which you will hit quota and will need to add your API key.

3. Restart Claude Desktop to load the new server.

### Claude Desktop Configuration (Windows)

1. Open your Claude Desktop configuration file:

   ```
   %APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
   ```

2. Add the InfraNodus server configuration:

a. remote launch via `npx`:

```json
 "infranodus": {
			"command": "npx",
			"args": ["-y", "infranodus-mcp-server"],
			"env": {
				"INFRANODUS_API_KEY": "YOUR_INFRANODUS_API_KEY"
			}
   },
```

b. launch this repo with `node`:

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"infranodus": {
			"command": "node",
			"args": ["C:\\path\\to\\mcp-server-infranodus\\dist\\index.js"],
			"env": {
				"INFRANODUS_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
			}
		}
	}
}
```

3. Restart Claude Desktop.

### Cursor Configuration

### Other MCP-Compatible Applications

For other applications supporting MCP, use the following command to start the server via npx:

```bash
INFRANODUS_API_KEY=your-api-key npx -y infranodus-mcp-server
```

or locally

```bash
INFRANODUS_API_KEY=your-api-key node /path/to/mcp-server-infranodus/dist/index.js
```

The server communicates via stdio, so configure your application to run this command and communicate through standard input/output.

## Usage Examples

Once installed, you can ask Claude to:

- "Use InfraNodus to analyze this text and show me the main topics"
- "Generate a knowledge graph from this document"
- "Find content gaps in this article"
- "Retrieve my existing graph called 'Research Notes' from InfraNodus"
- "What are the structural gaps in this text?"
- "Identify the most influential concepts in this content"

## Development

## API Documentation

### generate_knowledge_graph

Analyzes text and generates a knowledge graph.

**Parameters:**

- `text` (string, required): The text to analyze
- `includeStatements` (boolean): Include original statements in response
- `modifyAnalyzedText` (string): Text modification options ("none", "entities", "lemmatize")

### analyze_existing_graph_by_name

**Parameters:**

- `graphName` (string, required): Name of the existing graph
- `includeStatements` (boolean): Include statements in response
- `includeGraphSummary` (boolean): Include graph summary

### generate_content_gaps

Identifies content gaps and missing connections in text.

**Parameters:**

- `text` (string, required): The text to analyze for gaps

## Progress Notifications

For long-running operations (like SEO analysis), the MCP server supports **real-time progress notifications** that provide intermediary feedback to AI agents. This allows agents to:

- Track the progress of multi-step operations
- Display status messages to users
- Understand what's happening during lengthy analyses

### Implementation

The server implements MCP progress notifications using:

1. **ToolHandlerContext**: All tool handlers can receive an optional context parameter containing the server instance and progress token
2. **ProgressReporter**: A utility class that simplifies sending progress updates with percentages and messages
3. **Wrapped Handlers**: Tool registration automatically injects the server context into handlers

### Example Usage in Tools

```typescript
import { ProgressReporter } from "../utils/progress.js";
import { ToolHandlerContext } from "../types/index.js";

handler: async (params: ParamType, context: ToolHandlerContext = {}) => {
	const progress = new ProgressReporter(context);

	await progress.report(25, "Fetching data from API...");
	// Do work

	await progress.report(75, "Analyzing results...");
	// More work

	await progress.report(100, "Complete!");
	return results;
};
```

The `generate_seo_report` tool demonstrates this pattern with 6 major progress checkpoints that provide detailed status updates throughout the multi-step analysis process.
